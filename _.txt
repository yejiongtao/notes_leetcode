	Algorithm complexity
	sorting
		know about at least one O(nlogn) algo, (e.g. merge sort, quick sort)
		merge sort is useful when quicksort is not possible
	hashtables
		be able to implement one uising only arrays
	trees
		binary trees, n-ary trees, trie-trees
		familiar with at least one balanced binary tree
			red/black tree, splay tree, AVL tree
		BFS, DFS, inorder, preorder, postorder
	graphs
		3 ways to represent graphs (objects and points, matrix, adjacency lists)
		BFS, DFS, their time complexity, tradeoffs
		fancier algorithms like Dijkstra, A*
		think about graph first whenever someone gives you a question!!!
	other data structures
		NP-complete, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem
		just study a data structure book and remember as much as you can
	math
		distrete math, such as counting problems, probability problems
	OS
		Concurrent Programming in Java
